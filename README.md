My solution to the QR Code Component challenge on frontend mentor.

This was done with vanilla CSS and HTML.

My first challenge on the site, it's not the prettiest, but it has shown me areas that I need to improve in, and I will come back to it after I learn more and improve it.

The biggest challenge I had on this project was the image size and making sure it filled the container, and it's border radius was rendered correctly.
